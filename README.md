# Report Generation for the Entry Level Gate Assessment Survey 

## What is this?

Workflow: 
- Qualtrics survey filled by all coaches 
- The last coach clicks on 'Generate Report'
- Report is sent to email that corresponds to their lab.
  
**This repository only includes the Google Sheets programmation using Google App Scripts. This programmation generates and sends the report automatically when the coach clicks on 'Generate Report'.**

## Why is this here?
Since there might be extensive tweaking of the project, this version is saved as an initial working version.

## So the project works?
- It works when the webapp is deployed by my personal email (1) and when 'Anyone' is set to use it (2)
- But as we moved to a new Venture Labs Google Workspace, we found that my work email can deploy it (1) but 'Only Unternehmertum Members' can use it (2).
- Solution Suggestion: we need to create a new email to deploy it (1) and find a way for 'Anyone' or at least Qualtrics to use it (2). 

## Thank you
To Stefano and Lucia for letting me join their Focus Team, and best of luck to Alex with the final touches !
